# Motivations

Keycloak provides [theme support](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#_themes) for web pages. This allows customizing the look and feel of end-user facing pages so they can be integrated with your applications.
It involves, however, a lot of raw JS/CSS/[FTL]() hacking, and bundling the theme is not exactly straightforward.

Beyond that, if you use Keycloak for a specific app you want your login page to be tightly integrated with it.
Ideally, you don't want the user to notice when he is being redirected away. 

Trying to reproduce the look and feel of a specific app in another stack is not an easy task not to mention
the cheer amount of maintenance that it involves.

<p align="center">
    <i>Without keycloakify, users suffers from a harsh context switch, no fronted form pre-validation</i><br>

</p>

Wouldn't it be great if we could just design the login and register pages as if they were part of our app?  
Here is `keycloakify` for you üç∏

*NOTE: No autocomplete here just because it was an incognito window.*  

If you already have a Keycloak custom theme, it can be easily ported to Keycloakify.

# How to use

**TL;DR**: [Here](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app) is a Hello World React project with Keycloakify set up.  
## Setting up the build tool

```bash
yarn add keycloakify
```

[`package.json`](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/main/package.json)
```json
"scripts": {
    "keycloak": "yarn build && build-keycloak-theme",
}
```

```bash
yarn keycloak # generates keycloak-theme.jar
```

On the console will be printed all the instructions about how to load the generated theme in Keycloak

### Changing just the look of the default Keycloak theme

The first approach is to only customize the style of the default Keycloak login by providing
your own class names.

If you have created a new React project specifically to create a Keycloak theme and nothing else then
your index should look something like:  

`src/index.tsx`
```tsx
import {¬†App } from "./<wherever>/App";
import { 
  KcApp, 
  defaultKcProps, 
  kcContext
} from "keycloakify";
import {¬†css }¬†from "tss-react";

const myClassName = css({ "color": "red" });

reactDom.render(
        <KcApp 
            kcContext={kcContext} 
            {...{
                ...defaultKcProps,
                "kcHeaderWrapperClass": myClassName
            }} 
        />
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

If you have a unique project for your app and the Keycloak theme, your index should look
more like this: 

`src/index.tsx`
```tsx
import {¬†App } from "./<wherever>/App";
import { 
  KcApp, 
  defaultKcProps, 
  kcContext
} from "keycloakify";
import {¬†css }¬†from "tss-react";

const myClassName = css({ "color": "red" });

reactDom.render(
    // Unless the app is currently being served by Keycloak 
    // kcContext is undefined.
    kcContext !== undefined ? 
        <KcApp 
            kcContext={kcContext} 
            {...{
                ...defaultKcProps,
                "kcHeaderWrapperClass": myClassName
            }} 
        /> :
        <App />, // Your actual app
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

</p>

Example of a customization using only CSS: [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui/blob/012639d62327a9a56be80c46e32c32c9497b82db/src/app/components/KcApp.tsx) 
(the [index.tsx](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui/blob/012639d62327a9a56be80c46e32c32c9497b82db/src/app/index.tsx#L89-L94) )
and the result you can expect:

    <br>
    <img src="https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/releases/download/v0.3.8/keycloakify_after.gif">
</p>

### Changing the look **and** feel

If you want to really re-implement the pages, the best approach is to 
create your own version of the [`<KcApp />`](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify/blob/develop/src/lib/components/KcApp.tsx).
Copy/past some of [the components](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify/tree/develop/src/lib/components) provided by this module and start hacking around. 

You can find an example of such customization [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui/tree/master/src/app/components/KcApp).

And you can test the result in production by trying the login register page of [Onyxia](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr)

### Hot reload

Rebuild the theme each time you make a change to see the result is not practical.
If you want to test your login screens outside of Keycloak, in [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
for example you can use `kcContextMocks`.

```tsx
import {
    KcApp,
    defaultKcProps,
    kcContextMocks
} from "keycloakify";

reactDom.render(
        <KcApp 
            kcContext={kcContextMocks.kcLoginContext}
            {...defaultKcProps} 
        />
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Then `yarn start`, you will see your login page.

Checkout [this concrete example](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/main/src/index.tsx)

## Enable loading in a blink of an eye of login pages ‚ö° (--external-assets)

By default the theme generated is standalone. Meaning that when your users
reach the login pages all scripts, images and stylesheet are downloaded from the Keycloak server.  
If you are specifically building a theme to integrate with an app or a website that allows users
to first browse unauthenticated before logging in, you will get a significant 
performance boost if you jump through those hoops:

- Provide the url of your app in the `homepage` field of package.json. [ex](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/7847cc70ef374ab26a6cc7953461cf25603e9a6d/package.json#L2)
- Build the theme using `npx build-keycloak-theme --external-assets` [ex](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/7847cc70ef374ab26a6cc7953461cf25603e9a6d/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L21)
- Enable [long-term assets caching](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build/#static-file-caching) on the server hosting your app.
- Make sure not to build your app and the keycloak theme separately
  and remember to update the Keycloak theme every time you update your app.
- Be mindful that if your app is down your login pages are down as well.

Checkout a complete setup [here](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app#about-keycloakify)

# Support for Terms and conditions

[Many organizations have a requirement that when a new user logs in for the first time, they need to agree to the terms and conditions of the website.](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/4.8/server_admin/#terms-and-conditions).

First you need to enable the required action on the Keycloak server admin console:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/114280501-dad2e600-9a39-11eb-9c39-a225572dd38a.png)

Then to load your own therms of services using [like this](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/8168c928a66605f2464f9bd28a4dc85fb0a231f9/src/index.tsx#L42-L66).

# GitHub Actions

[Here is a demo repo](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app) to show how to automate
the building and publishing of the theme (the .jar file).

# Requirements 

Tested with the following Keycloak versions: 
- [11.0.3](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/11.0.3/images/sha256-4438f1e51c1369371cb807dffa526e1208086b3ebb9cab009830a178de949782?context=explore)  
- [12.0.4](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jboss/keycloak/12.0.4/images/sha256-67e0c88e69bd0c7aef972c40bdeb558a974013a28b3668ca790ed63a04d70584?context=explore)  

This tool will be maintained to stay compatible with Keycloak v11 and up, however, the default pages you will get 
(before you customize it) will always be the ones of Keycloak v11.

This tool assumes you are bundling your app with Webpack (tested with 4.44.2) .
It assumes there is a `build/` directory at the root of your react project directory containing a `index.html` file
and a `build/static/` directory generated by webpack.

**All this is defaults with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev)** (tested with 4.0.3)

- For building the theme: `mvn` (Maven) must be installed (but you can build the theme in the CI)
- For testing the theme in a local Keycloak container (which is not mandatory for development): 
  `rm`, `mkdir`, `wget`, `unzip` are assumed to be available and `docker` up and running.
# Limitations
## `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` not supported.

You won't be able to [import things from your public directory **in your JavaScript code**](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/#adding-assets-outside-of-the-module-system). 
(This isn't recommended anyway).

## `@font-face` importing fonts from the¬†`src/` dir

If you are building the theme with [--external-assets](#enable-loading-in-a-blink-of-a-eye-of-login-pages-) 
this limitation doesn't apply, you can import fonts however you see fit.

### Example of setup that **won't** work 

- We have a `fonts/` directory in `src/`
- We import the font like this [`src: url("/fonts/my-font.woff2") format("woff2");`](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/07d54a3012ef354ee12b1374c6f7ad1cb125d56b/src/fonts.scss#L4) in a `.scss` a file.  

### Possible workarounds  

- Use [`--external-assets`](#enable-loading-in-a-blink-of-a-eye-of-login-pages-).
- If it is possible, use Google Fonts or any other font provider.
- If you want to host your font recommended approach is to move your fonts into the `public` 
directory and to place your `@font-face` statements in the `public/index.html`.  
Example [here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui/blob/0e3a04610cfe872ca71dad59e05ced8f785dee4b/public/index.html#L6-L51).  
- You can also [use non relative url](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/2de8a9eb6f5de9c94f9cd3991faad0377e63268c/src/fonts.scss#L16) but don't forget [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://github.com/garronej/keycloakify-demo-app/blob/2de8a9eb6f5de9c94f9cd3991faad0377e63268c/nginx.conf#L17-L19).

# Implement context persistence (optional)

If, before logging in, a user has selected a specific language 
you don't want it to be reset to default when the user gets redirected to
the login or register pages.  
  
Same goes for the dark mode, you don't want, if the user had it enabled
to show the login page with light themes.  
  
The problem is that you are probably using `localStorage` to persist theses values across
reload but, as the Keycloak pages are not served on the same domain that the rest of your
app you won't be able to carry over states using `localStorage`.  

The only reliable solution is to inject parameters into the URL before
redirecting to Keycloak. We integrate with 
[`keycloak-js`](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-documentation/blob/master/securing_apps/topics/oidc/javascript-adapter.adoc), 
by providing you a way to tell `keycloak-js` that you would like to inject
some search parameters before redirecting.  

The method also works with [`@react-keycloak/web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-keycloak/web) (use the `initOptions`).

You can implement your own mechanism to pass the states in the URL and
restore it on the other side but we recommend using `powerhooks/useGlobalState`
from the library [`powerhooks`](https://www.powerhooks.dev) that provide an elegant
way to handle states such as `isDarkModeEnabled` or `selectedLanguage`.

Let's modify [the example](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-documentation/blob/master/securing_apps/topics/oidc/javascript-adapter.adoc) from the official `keycloak-js` documentation to
enables the states of `useGlobalStates` to be injected in the URL before redirecting.  
Note that the states are automatically restored on the other side by `powerhooks`

```typescript
import keycloak_js from "keycloak-js";
import { injectGlobalStatesInSearchParams } from "powerhooks/useGlobalState";
import { createKeycloakAdapter¬†} from "keycloakify";

//...

const keycloakInstance = keycloak_js({
    "url": "http://keycloak-server/auth",
    "realm": "myrealm",
    "clientId": "myapp"
});

keycloakInstance.init({
    "onLoad": 'check-sso',
    "silentCheckSsoRedirectUri": window.location.origin + "/silent-check-sso.html",
    "adapter": createKeycloakAdapter({
        "transformUrlBeforeRedirect": injectGlobalStatesInSearchParams,
        keycloakInstance
    })
});

//...
```

If you really want to go the extra miles and avoid having the white
flash of the blank html before the js bundle have been evaluated
[here is a snippet](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-ui/blob/a77eb502870cfe6878edd0d956c646d28746d053/public/index.html#L5-L54) that you can place in your `public/index.html` if you are using `powerhooks/useGlobalState`.
